## Implementation Report

  We intend to implement the Monopoly game with extra features for a desktop computer, written in
Java. The game includes the base game features of rolling the dice and moving accordingly, purchasing
unowned properties when you land on them, paying the appropriate rent when the piece lands on another
player’s property, drawing chance and community chest cards when landed on appropriate tiles, building
houses and hotels on the properties of a completed set, auctioning of properties that are not purchased when
landed on, and the classic jail system.
#
  We intend to implement the option to play the game as a local multiplayer on the same machine
and the option to play against the AI. The game will be played with 2 to 6 players, including a combination
of AI’s and real players.
#
For playing against the AI, we plan to implement different characteristics for AI, which the user is
able to choose to play against predefined AI characteristics. This way, users can choose from a variety of
AI as their opponent: how stingy the AI is with its money, its tendency to acquire new properties, or hold
onto its money. The AI will be able to analyze the board and the game and decide on whether to buy a
property or not, and evaluate the barter offers made to it.
#
  We plan to implement options for users to save and load the games that enables users to save their
unfinished games to be played later on, and load any saved games.
 #
  We wish to change two train stations in classic monopoly into airports. Should a player land on an
airport, they will be transported to the other airport.
  #
  We also plan to implement a barter system, where the players can swap properties or buy each
other’s properties using their money.
  #
  When playing (starting to the game), there will be an option for users to choose the pace and
difficulty of the game, which alters the rents of the properties, prices of the properties etc. (starting
conditions), and therefore can help the game last longer or shorter.
  #
  Furthermore, we want the users to be able to customize the board they are playing with, which
includes the names of the properties, their rents etc. The game already comes with a set of boards that
incorporates a theme, but the user can also make, save, and play on their own map.
